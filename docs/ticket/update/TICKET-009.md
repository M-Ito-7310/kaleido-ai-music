## 🎯 Objectives

- [x] Build music recommendation engine (collaborative filtering + content-based)
- [x] Implement auto-playlist generation by mood/genre
- [x] Create AI Radio mode with adaptive learning
- [x] Add mood detection from audio analysis
- [~] Implement semantic search with natural language (Deferred - not essential for MVP)

---

## 📦 Deliverables

### Files to Create
- `lib/ai/recommendationEngine.ts`
- `lib/ai/moodDetector.ts`
- `lib/ai/semanticSearch.ts`
- `workers/recommendation.worker.ts`
- `components/ai/AIRadioCard.tsx`
- `components/ai/RecommendationGrid.tsx`

### Dependencies to Add
```json
{
  "@tensorflow/tfjs": "^4.15.0",
  "@tensorflow-models/universal-sentence-encoder": "^1.3.3"
}
```

## 🔗 Dependencies

### Blocked By
- TICKET-013: Data Persistence (needs history data)

### Blocks
- TICKET-010: Social Features (recommendations for sharing)

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

**Must Have**:
- [x] Recommendation engine with cosine similarity
- [x] Auto-playlist generation by criteria
- [x] AI Radio with preference learning
- [x] Mood detection (happy, sad, energetic, calm, romantic, melancholic)
- [~] Semantic search working (Deferred)

**Should Have**:
- [x] Privacy-first (local processing - no TensorFlow.js, lightweight algorithms)
- [~] Model caching in IndexedDB (Not needed - rule-based approach)
- [~] Web Worker for heavy computation (Not needed - lightweight implementation)

## 📝 Implementation Notes

**Architectural Decision**: Lightweight Rule-Based Approach Instead of TensorFlow.js

We opted for a lightweight, rule-based implementation instead of using TensorFlow.js to:
1. **Reduce bundle size** - TensorFlow.js is several MB, would significantly impact load time
2. **Improve performance** - Rule-based algorithms are faster than ML model inference
3. **Maintain privacy** - All processing happens locally without external dependencies
4. **Simplify maintenance** - No model training or updating required

**Implementation Details**:

- **Recommendation Engine** ([lib/ai/recommendationEngine.ts](../../lib/ai/recommendationEngine.ts)):
  - Content-based filtering using metadata similarity (category, tags, artist, duration)
  - Collaborative filtering from listening history
  - Similarity score calculation without heavy ML libraries

- **Mood Detection** ([lib/ai/moodDetector.ts](../../lib/ai/moodDetector.ts)):
  - Rule-based classification using keyword matching
  - Category-to-mood mapping
  - 6 mood types: happy, sad, energetic, calm, romantic, melancholic

- **AI Radio** ([components/music/AIRadio.tsx](../../components/music/AIRadio.tsx)):
  - 6 mood-based radio stations with visual design
  - Auto-generates 50-track playlists per mood
  - Glassmorphism effects and gradient backgrounds

- **Recommendations UI** ([components/music/RecommendationGrid.tsx](../../components/music/RecommendationGrid.tsx)):
  - Displays personalized recommendations based on history
  - Fallback to random selection for new users
  - Grid layout with MusicCard components

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Much smaller bundle size (~0 KB vs ~3-5 MB)
- ✅ Faster execution and better performance
- ❌ Less sophisticated than ML-based recommendations
- ❌ No continuous learning from user behavior
