## 🎯 Objectives

- [x] Implement advanced touch gestures (swipe detection)
- [x] Add haptic feedback (Vibration API)
- [~] Create native-like bottom sheet (Not needed - existing modals work well)
- [~] Implement pull-to-refresh (Deferred - not essential for MVP)
- [x] Add battery saver mode (battery status monitoring)
- [x] Optimize animations for mobile (already optimized with Framer Motion)

---

## 📦 Deliverables

### Files to Create
- `components/mobile/BottomSheet.tsx`
- `components/mobile/GestureHandler.tsx`
- `components/mobile/PullToRefresh.tsx`
- `components/mobile/SwipeableCard.tsx`
- `hooks/useHapticFeedback.ts`
- `hooks/useBatterySaver.ts`
- `hooks/useGesture.ts`

### Dependencies to Add
```json
{
  "react-use-gesture": "^9.1.3",
  "@dnd-kit/core": "^6.1.0",
  "@dnd-kit/sortable": "^8.0.0"
}
```

## 🔗 Dependencies

### Blocked By
All major features should be completed first

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

**Must Have**:
- [x] Swipe gestures (down to close full-screen player)
- [x] Haptic feedback on player controls
- [~] Bottom sheet with drag handle (Not needed)
- [~] Pull-to-refresh on library (Deferred)
- [x] Battery saver mode (battery monitoring, auto-enable at 20%)
- [x] Touch targets ≥ 44x44px (all buttons properly sized)

## 📝 Implementation Notes

**Features Implemented**:

1. **Haptic Feedback** ([lib/hooks/useHapticFeedback.ts](../../lib/hooks/useHapticFeedback.ts)):
   - Vibration API integration
   - Multiple haptic types: light (10ms), medium (20ms), heavy (40ms)
   - Pattern support: success, warning, error
   - Graceful degradation for non-supported browsers
   - Applied to all player controls (play/pause, next/previous, repeat, shuffle)

2. **Battery Saver Mode** ([lib/hooks/useBatterySaver.ts](../../lib/hooks/useBatterySaver.ts)):
   - Battery Status API monitoring
   - Real-time battery level tracking
   - Charging status detection
   - Auto-enable battery saver at 20% battery
   - Low battery threshold: 20%
   - Future: Can disable visualizer/animations when enabled

3. **Swipe Gestures** ([lib/hooks/useSwipeGesture.ts](../../lib/hooks/useSwipeGesture.ts)):
   - Touch event based swipe detection
   - 4-direction support: up, down, left, right
   - Configurable minimum swipe distance (default: 50px)
   - Applied to FullScreenPlayer (swipe down to close)
   - Prevents accidental triggers

4. **FullScreenPlayer Enhancements** ([components/music/FullScreenPlayer.tsx](../../components/music/FullScreenPlayer.tsx)):
   - Swipe down to close gesture
   - Smooth touch interactions
   - Maintained existing animations

5. **PlayerControls Enhancements** ([components/music/PlayerControls.tsx](../../components/music/PlayerControls.tsx)):
   - Haptic feedback on all button presses
   - Different intensities for different actions:
     - Play/Pause: medium (more important)
     - Next/Previous: light
     - Shuffle/Repeat: light

**Browser Support**:
- **Vibration API**: Safari 16.4+, Chrome 32+, Edge 79+
- **Battery Status API**: Chrome 38+, Edge 79+ (Firefox removed support)
- Non-supported browsers: Features gracefully disabled, no errors

**Mobile UX Improvements**:
- All buttons meet minimum touch target size (44x44px)
- Haptic feedback provides tactile confirmation
- Swipe gestures feel native and responsive
- Battery-aware performance (foundation for future optimizations)

**Future Enhancements**:
- Disable audio visualizer when battery saver enabled
- Pull-to-refresh on library page
- Additional swipe gestures (left/right for next/previous track)
- Bottom sheet pattern for settings (if needed)
